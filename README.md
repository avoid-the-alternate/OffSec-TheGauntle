# OffSec-TheGauntlet-WriteUp (Write-ups from the most prestigious, awesome, amazing placement ever 526/4267)

During October 7 - December 2, 2025, Offensive Security organized a wonderful event: The Gauntlet Echo Response. 
I was so hyped, given it was an event promoted targeting Blue Team guys. 

In total, the event contained 9 rooms(one of which was the tutorial, which I totally nailed it.) 

The event ended, and to be honest now, I'm happy I got to take part in this event, and my placement doesn't bother me at all... 

I set up this repository as I want to put up write-ups for the Rooms I completed. I will probably add the things I tried for the other rooms. Everything was done by myself, I tried to use any AI assistance as little as possible(I'll mention sections or areas where I used any AI assistance.)

So, here we go! The Gauntlet!
